**Inspiration**

After Covid-19, Russia-Ukraine crisis is touching everyday life.  In this era of globalization, its effects are not localized but being felt around the world via three main channels: financial sanctions, commodity prices and supply chain disruptions. The humanitarian cost is also staggering with reports of tens of thousands killed and millions becoming refugees. 

Against this backdrop, it is but natural to expeditiously look for a solution to cease fighting. An immediate way is to target Russia’s finances by constricting its exports. It resulted in a mostly West led call to shun Russian oil. India, however, moved in opposite direction. This led to a barrage of articles claiming ‘India is financing Russian war efforts’  <sup>see footnotes</sup>. On being probed, India’s EAM Dr Jaishankar highlighted continued EU imports and said “All of us would like to find the right balance of our interests (continued Russian imports) and values (moral dilemma)." 

This project is a sincere effort to gauge dependence on Russia to meet domestic energy requirements by European Union (EU) and India.
